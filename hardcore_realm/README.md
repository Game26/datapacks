# Hardcore Realm

A small datapack that turns your realm into hardcore mode, by putting everyone who dies into spectator mode.

[latest version](https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/hardcore_realm/hardcore_realm_v1.0.zip) (for mc 1.16.5)

## How to set up

### Existing world  
Download the zip file and place it into your world/datapacks folder. If the world is already running, run reload. That's all you need to do.

**Realm**  
1. (Skip if you're uploading a singleplayer world anyways) Download the world you want to turn into a hardcore world to your singleplayer worlds
2. Copy the data pack into the world's datapack folder.
3. Reupload the world to the realm.

### New world

You can add the datapack directly when creating the world.

**Realm**  
Create the world on singleplayer and upload it to your realm after that.
